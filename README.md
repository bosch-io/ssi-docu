# SSI Documentation repository for Catena-X

This repository contains documentation about the Self-Sovereign Identity solution that is to be used within Catena-X.

It does not specify any implementations, not does it contain any, it is simply to be understood as the reference point for every future implementor.

We sometimes refer to this repository as the "single source of truth" regarding all things SSI. All documentation and specifications revolving around this topic are to be consolidated here.

> This repository is intended to contain documents and graphs in an easily versionable format. We prefer Markdown and PlantUML over `*.docx` and `*.pdf`.
